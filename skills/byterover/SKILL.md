# ByteRover Context Tree

A project-level knowledge repository that persists across sessions. Use it to avoid re-discovering patterns, conventions, and decisions.

## Why Use ByteRover

- **Query before working**: Get existing knowledge about patterns, conventions, and past decisions before implementing
- **Curate after learning**: Capture insights, decisions, and bug fixes so future sessions start informed

## Quick Reference

| Command | When | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| `brv query "question"` | Before starting work | `brv query "How is auth implemented?"` |
| `brv curate "context" -f file` | After completing work | `brv curate "JWT 24h expiry" -f auth.ts` |
| `brv status` | To check prerequisites | `brv status` |

## When to Use

**Query** when you need to understand something:
- "How does X work in this codebase?"
- "What patterns exist for Y?"
- "Are there conventions for Z?"

**Curate** when you learned or created something valuable:
- Implemented a feature using specific patterns
- Fixed a bug and found root cause
- Made an architecture decision

## Curate Quality

Context must be **specific** and **actionable**:

```bash
# Good - specific, explains where and why
brv curate "Auth uses JWT 24h expiry, tokens in httpOnly cookies" -f src/auth.ts

# Bad - too vague
brv curate "Fixed auth"
```

**Note:** Context argument must come before `-f` flags. Max 5 files.

## Best Practices

1. **Break down large contexts** - Run multiple `brv curate` commands for complex topics rather than one massive context. Smaller chunks are easier to retrieve and update.

2. **Let ByteRover read files** - Don't read files yourself before curating. Use `-f` flags to let ByteRover read them directly:
   ```bash
   # Good - ByteRover reads the files
   brv curate "Auth implementation details" -f src/auth.ts -f src/middleware/jwt.ts

   # Wasteful - reading files twice
   # [agent reads files] then brv curate "..." -f same-files
   ```

3. **Be specific in queries** - Queries block your workflow. Use precise questions to get faster, more relevant results:
   ```bash
   # Good - specific
   brv query "What validation library is used for API request schemas?"

   # Bad - vague, slow
   brv query "How is validation done?"
   ```

4. **Signal outdated context** - When curating updates that replace existing knowledge, explicitly tell ByteRover to clean up:
   ```bash
   brv curate "OUTDATED: Previous auth used sessions. NEW: Now uses JWT with refresh tokens. Clean up old session-based auth context." -f src/auth.ts
   ```

5. **Specify structure expectations** - Guide ByteRover on how to organize the knowledge:
   ```bash
   # Specify topics/domains
   brv curate "Create separate topics for: 1) JWT validation, 2) refresh token flow, 3) logout handling" -f src/auth.ts

   # Specify detail level
   brv curate "Document the error handling patterns in detail (at least 30 lines covering all error types)" -f src/errors/
   ```

## Prerequisites

Run `brv status` first. If errors occur, the agent cannot fix them—instruct the user to take action in their brv terminal. See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for details.
