# Static Deploy

Deploy static files to `<project-slug>.nexu.space` via Wrangler + Cloudflare Pages.

The deploy script stages a temporary copy of the site and injects a `_headers`
file (if needed) with cache revalidation rules for HTML/CSS/JS to reduce stale
asset issues after redeploys. Source files are not modified.

## What it deploys

Any static files: HTML, CSS, JS, images, fonts, etc. Common use cases:
- Single-page apps (React, Vue, etc. — deploy the `dist/` or `build/` folder)
- Landing pages, portfolios, documentation sites
- Quick prototypes or demos
- Any folder with an `index.html`

## Usage

1. Identify the directory containing files to deploy (must have an `index.html`)
2. Derive a project-slug from context (e.g., "family budget" → `family-budget`)
   - Lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens only, max 63 characters
   - Reuse the same slug for redeployments
   - Ask user to confirm if ambiguous
3. Run deploy with the inbound structured context:

```bash
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/deploy.sh" <project-slug> <directory> <agent-id> <chat-id> [thread-id] [message-ref] [account-id] [channel] [chat-type] [sender-ref]
```

`agent-id` is required. The script uses it to resolve the corresponding `botId`
from `nexu-context.json` when recording deployment artifacts.

`chat-id` is the raw inbound chat identifier from the message context.

- DM example: `U0AHLMC6C8G`
- Channel example: `C0AJKG60H6D`

`chat-type` tells the script whether to send that id to Nexu as `user:<chat-id>`
or `channel:<chat-id>`. The script does that translation; do not concatenate
those prefixes yourself.

`thread-id` is optional — pass it when deploying from within a thread context.
4. Parse the JSON output and report to user:
   - Brief summary of what was deployed
   - Live URL from the `url` field
   - **Important:** Tell the user that Cloudflare Pages propagation takes ~3 minutes. The URL may not work immediately after the first deploy. For redeployments, it's usually faster.

## Example reply

## Rules

- Never read, echo, or log `SKILL_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, or `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- Never pass credentials as command arguments
- Always use the bundled `deploy.sh` — do not call Cloudflare API directly
- Do not set `DEPLOY_BACKEND` or any other env overrides — the script handles everything
- Always pass the caller `<agent-id>` as arg #3 to `deploy.sh`
- Always pass raw inbound `<chat-id>` as arg #4
- Never pass `<agent-id>` as `<chat-id>`; they are different values
- If deploying from a thread, pass `<thread-id>` as arg #5
- Always pass `<channel>` and `<chat-type>` when available so Nexu can resolve the correct session deterministically
- Do not try to look up or persist a canonical session key in this skill; Nexu resolves it server-side
- Do not hand-edit source files just to add cache-busting query params; the deploy script handles cache revalidation via a staged `_headers` file
- If the script fails, show the `message` field from the JSON error to the user
- Cloudflare credentials are fetched at runtime via the scoped secrets API using `SKILL_API_TOKEN` from env — do not attempt to read or inject them manually
