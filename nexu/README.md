## 📊 Difference from other solutions

| | OpenClaw (official) | Typical hosted Feishu + agent stacks | **nexu** ✅ |
|---|---|---|---|
| **🧠 Models** | BYO, but manual config required ⚠️ | Platform-locked, no switching ❌ | **Pick Claude / GPT / Gemini, etc. — one-click switch in GUI** ✅ |
| **📡 Data path** | Local | Routed through vendor servers, data out of your control ❌ | **Local-first; we don't host your business data** ✅ |
| **💰 Cost** | Free, but self-deploy required ⚠️ | Subscription / per-seat pricing ❌ | **Client is free; pay providers via your own API keys** ✅ |
| **📜 Source** | Open source | Closed source, no audit possible ❌ | **MIT — fork and audit** ✅ |
| **🔗 Channels** | DIY integration required ⚠️ | Varies by vendor, often limited ❌ | **Built-in WeChat, Feishu, Slack, Discord — works out of the box** ✅ |
| **🖥 Interface** | CLI, requires technical skills ❌ | Varies by vendor | **Pure GUI, no CLI needed, double-click to start** ✅ |
